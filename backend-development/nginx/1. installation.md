# Install NGINX on ubuntu

## Installation

Install nginx from ubuntu default repository

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

Check nginx status

```
systemctl status nginx
```

Expected Output:

```
● nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2022-11-18 13:40:16 UTC; 3min 50s ago

## Firewall

UFW, or Uncomplicated Firewall, is a simplified firewall management interface. UFW is installed by default on Ubuntu. If it has been uninstalled for some reason, you can install it with `sudo apt install ufw`.

### Check ufw status

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Expected Output:
Status: inactive or Status: active

### Turn on ufw

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

### Turn off ufw

```bash
sudo ufw disable
```

### Allow/Deny Rules

```bash
sudo ufw [allow/deny] [port1][:port2 (optional)][/protocol (optional)] # Allow/Deny to a specific port/port range

sudo ufw [allow/deny] from [<ip/subnet>]  # Allow/Deny to a all ports a specific ip or subnet

sudo ufw [allow/deny] from [<ip/subnet>] to any port [port1][:port2 (optional)][/protocol (optional)] # Allow/Deny to a specific port/port range from a specific ip or subnet

sudo ufw allow 80 # Allow traffic to port 80 from anywhere

sudo ufw deny 80 # Deny traffic to port 80 from anywhere

sudo ufw allow ssh # Allow SSH
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp # Allow SSH

sudo ufw allow 6000:6379/tcp # Allow traffic to port 6000-6379 from anywhere

sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0/24 # Allow traffic from  all of the IP addresses ranging from 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254 to any port

sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0/24 # Deny any traffic from all of the IP addresses ranging from 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254

sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0/24 to any port 22 # Allow traffic from  all of the IP addresses ranging from 203.0.113.1 to 203.0.113.254 to ssh
```

### Setup NGINX with UFW

Upon installation `nginx` lists itself as a service with ufw

```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

Expected Output:

```
Output
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
```

Allow one of the following applications with uf

- Nginx Full: This profile opens both port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic) and port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)
- Nginx HTTP: This profile opens only port 80 (normal, unencrypted web traffic)
- Nginx HTTPS: This profile opens only port 443 (TLS/SSL encrypted traffic)

For now, allow only http connection

```
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo ufw status
```

## Testing NGINX web server

You can access the default Nginx landing page to confirm that the software is running properly by navigating to your server’s IP address. If you do not know your server’s IP address, you can find it by using the icanhazip.com tool, which will give you your public IP address as received from another location on the internet:

```bash
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

When you have your server’s IP address, enter it into your browser’s address bar:
`http://[IP ADDRESS]`

You should see Welcome to Nginx page. This means your nginx is installed and running properly.

## Managing NGINX process

Now that you have your web server up and running, let’s review some basic management commands.

To stop your web server, type:

```
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

To stop and then start the service again, type:

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

If you are only making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, type:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior by typing:

```
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

To re-enable the service to start up at boot, you can type:

```
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
