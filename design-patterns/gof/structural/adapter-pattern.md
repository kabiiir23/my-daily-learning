# Adapter Design Pattern

- It is a structural design pattern
- Can be used when there are two objects that have similar functionality but different interfaces.
- It allows existing classes to be used with others without modifying the code.
- Using an adapter class we are transforming one class to act like another.
- Code Example - [typescript](code/adpater-pattern.ts)
